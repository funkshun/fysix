<!--l. 14--><p class="noindent" >The questions that sparked this project were &#8217;How are ideas spread?&#8217; and &#8217;Can we
model this behavior?&#8217;. With internet access, &#8220;ideas&#8221; are spread more rapidly than
ever. Under the current polarized political climate as well as controversies of foul play
by social media platforms there seems to be a heightened interest in such behavior.
Our hypothesis is that <span 
class="cmbx-10">the spread of ideas can be modeled by the behavior of</span>
<span 
class="cmbx-10">infection.</span>
<!--l. 16--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-20002"></a>Method</h3>
<!--l. 18--><p class="noindent" >To probe this hypothesis we used data retrieved from Reddit, using the python
Reddit API wrapper PRAW. We used this data to get a measure of the
&#8217;connectedness&#8217; <span 
class="cmmi-10">L </span>between various subreddits; This term is a metric of how many
users on one subreddit are also active on some other chosen subreddit. For example,
if we want to determined the connectedness <span 
class="cmmi-10">L </span>of two subreddits indexed with <span 
class="cmmi-10">j </span>and
<span 
class="cmmi-10">k</span>, we look at the top <span 
class="cmmi-10">M </span>= 100 posts in the smaller (fewer subscriber) subreddit, and
see how many of the authors from that list have posted in the other subreddit. So, we
define <span 
class="cmmi-10">L </span>as
   <table 
class="equation"><tr><td><a 
 id="x1-2001r1"></a>

<!--l. 21--><p class="nopar" >
These <span 
class="cmmi-10">L </span>values are part of the realistic basis for our simulation.
<!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >   The mathematical model we used to simulate the spread of the ideas
within a single subreddit is derivde from the SIR model of the spread of
disease <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XSIR">1</a>]</span>, which gives a set a 3 coupled ODEs described by D. Smith and L.
Moore,

class="cmmi-10">s,i,r </span>are just the percentages of the population (of a given community)
susceptible, infected, and recovering, respectively (mutually exclusive of course). In
our analysis we used the analogy that s is the percentage of users of the given
subreddit who have not seen the &#8217;idea&#8217;, i is the percentage of users actively
discussing and/or posting about the idea, and r corresponds to the percentage
of users who have previously been &#8217;infected&#8217; and are no longer posting on
such an idea. Note that the above equation have constants <span 
class="cmmi-10">b </span>and <span 
class="cmmi-10">k </span>that
correspond to the contagion constant (the number of &#8217;contacts&#8217; needed to
spread the idea) and the recovery constant (the fraction of people who will
forget about certain idea over a certain time interval), respectively. The
last equation indicates that our model assumes that the total population of
Reddit users for a given subreddit does not change over time. Note that
we also assume the constants <span 
class="cmmi-10">b </span>and <span 
class="cmmi-10">k </span>to be different for each subreddit or

community. This means that an idea&#8217;s propagation will depend on the subreddit
community that it&#8217;s receiving it. For example, subreddits that generally
facilate the fast spread of new ideas will have a higher <span 
class="cmmi-10">b</span>, while subreddits that
usually forget about popular trends quickly will have a higher <span 
class="cmmi-10">r</span>. For our
simulations, we took educated guesses about the best <span 
class="cmmi-10">b </span>and <span 
class="cmmi-10">r </span>values for the
subreddits.
<!--l. 34--><p class="indent" >   In order to actually solve the ODE&#8217;s for each community that we&#8217;re considering,
we used a Runge-Kutta 4th order integration method (ODE solver) to solve the
system of equations, which we run for each time step, for each system of each
community.
<!--l. 35--><p class="indent" >   However, these ODE&#8217;s only model the spread of ideas <span 
class="cmbx-10">within </span>subreddits.
We also model the spread of ideas <span 
class="cmbx-10">between </span>subreddits, using a form of
conditional probabilistic Markov chain derived from the connectedness values. Say
that we have <span 
class="cmmi-10">N </span>subreddits in total, each with different <span 
class="cmmi-10">L </span>connectedness
values between every pair of them. For every noninfected subreddit, at each
time step we estimate the probability of the subreddit becoming infected
from any one of the infected subreddits, using the following (normalized)
estimate (which sums over the other <span 
class="cmmi-10">N </span><span 
class="cmsy-10">- </span>1 subreddits, which are indexed by
<span 
class="cmmi-10">k</span>:

<!--l. 40--><p class="indent" >   Notice that the <span

class="cmsy-10">&#x00D7; </span><span 
class="cmmi-10">N </span>matrix of <span 
class="cmmi-10">L </span>values is essentially used as a transition
matrix from Markov chain theory. The higher this probability, the higher the chance
that at the time step, the <span 
class="cmmi-10">jth </span>subreddit will become infected. This calculation is done
for each of the uninfected subreddits.
<!--l. 41--><p class="indent" >   Given more time than the 24-hour limit, we would&#8217;ve liked to slightly
correct the infection probability computation by accounting for the generalized
inclusion-exclusion principle of probabilities (to avoid over-counting). We also wanted
to compare our results to real reddit data over time, but it was difficult to get this
type of specific data for the precise range of times that we needed. We visualized this
entire process on the main page.
